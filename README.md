# Totem
Modular prototype framework for the web.

## Installation
First, install Yeoman and generator-totem using npm (we assume you have pre-installed node.js).

Then install your new project:

```bash
yo totem:install
```

## Setup your first module
Setting up a module, page or template file is very easy by using the Yeoman Generator  (generator-totem). You can easily create one within the Totem structure by running the following command:

```bash
yo totem
```
