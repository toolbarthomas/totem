// Default template
//
// The standard Template for our app.
// All import logic is defined within the Templates directory (for example; this file).
// The default Template should not be adjusted since it does a globbing import within all types
// Other Template files should have specific import's to reduce the file size of the generated stylesheet.
// you should import your types in the following order:
//
// 1. Base - Global styling for your app goes here; e.g. branding & typography styles. Your base file should only have on variant to avoid complexity.
// 2. Objects - Undecorated design patterns like containers and wrappers are defined in this sectionClass-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS. Your app can contain multiple Objects and must defined within it's own folder.
// 3. Components - Class-based UI components will be defined here, ID-based styling isn't allowed in this section. Your app can contain multiple Components and must defined within it's own folder.
// 4. Pages - Specific page styling & overrides should be defined here. - Your app can contain multiple Pages and must defined within it's own folder.
//
// Each type uses the same order of import, we do this so we can share all stylesheets within the project.
// The expected import order for all section is defined below:
//
// 1. Utilities
// 2. Helpers - Additional functions that should be only used within tool definitions.
// 3. Settings - Store variables ( global and/or default ) here.
// 4. Tools - Mixins & functions are defined here ( include the needed dependencies when using additional compatible libraries )
// 5. Generic - Default styles are defined here, e.g. reset css
// 6. Elements - Typography & global styling for common elements are defined here.
